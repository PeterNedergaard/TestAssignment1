## 1 Reflections


### 1.1 Shooting

**A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying:**

- The shot did not hit
- The woman fired a round with no projectile
- The man can't die
- The man is already dead
- The shot didn't do fatal damage
- The round didn't contain enough gunpowder to make the projectile reach the woman


### 1.2 Alien

**An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can:**

1. Remove the cap from the toothpaste.
2. With one hand, pick up the toothbrush with the bristle-end facing upwards and away from you
3. With the other hand, pick up the toothpaste, and gently squeeze it to force out a pea-sized glob of toothpaste
4. Apply the toothpaste-glob to the bristles of the toothbrush
5. Open the faucet slightly, and make sure the water is cold
6. Reach the toothbrush into the stream of water for about 1 second
7. Put the bristles of the toothbrush on the face of your front-teeth
8. Move the toothbrush in circles, while moving the toothbrush across your teeth
9. Move the toothbrush to the bottom of your teeth, and do step 8 again
10. Move the toothbrush to the backside of your teeth, and do step 8 again
11. Spit out remaining toothpaste into the sink
12. Repeatedly rinse your mouth with water from the faucet, until little or no toothpaste remains in your mouth. Mouth-water is to be discarded in the sink
13. Rinse the toothbrush under running water from the faucet
14. If not already done, put the cap back on the toothpaste
15. Dry off the toothbrush, and put it back where you found it


## 3 Give your thoughts on TDD

**What was positive and good about using TDD?**
- An isolated environment for testing and running methods individually.
- Because of writing the smallest implementation to make the test pass, you quickly get a working solution, which you can then refactor or build on top of. This way, you will easier find the problem if tests begin to fail, as its most likely caused by the code you have recently written.


**What was annoying or difficult?**
- Remembering to implement the test first, and not just begin to code straight away.

**What surprised you?**
- Testing is easier and more intuitive than I recall from previous semesters.

**Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?**
- I'm unsure. Maybe it did the opposite, as I had a better understanding of the potential failures only after actually working with the inner parts of the methods.
