### 1.2 Alien

**An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can:**

1. Remove the cap from the toothpaste.
2. With one hand, pick up the toothbrush with the bristle-end facing upwards and away from you
3. With the other hand, pick up the toothpaste, and gently squeeze it to force out a pea-sized glob of toothpaste
4. Apply the toothpaste-glob to the bristles of the toothbrush
5. Open the faucet slightly, and make sure the water is cold
6. Reach the toothbrush into the stream of water for about 1 second
7. Put the bristles of the toothbrush on the face of your front-teeth
8. Move the toothbrush in circles, while moving the toothbrush across your teeth
9. Move the toothbrush to the bottom of your teeth, and do step 8 again
10. Move the toothbrush to the backside of your teeth, and do step 8 again
11. Spit out remaining toothpaste into the sink
12. Repeatedly rinse your mouth with water from the faucet, until little or no toothpaste remains in your mouth. Mouth-water is to be discarded in the sink
13. Rinse the toothbrush under running water from the faucet
14. If not already done, put the cap back on the toothpaste
15. Dry off the toothbrush, and put it back where you found it
